## 🧑‍💻 How We Built This (The Transformation Story)

- **Sprint 1:** Started with a basic Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind portfolio. Each section was functional but visually disconnected and lacking polish.
- **Design Audit:** Reviewed every section for consistency, accessibility, and modern UI/UX best practices.
- **Apple-Inspired Redesign:** Unified all cards, tags, and buttons with gradients, shadows, and smooth transitions. Added animated underline to NavBar, improved mobile menu, and ensured accessibility.
- **Microinteractions:** Added subtle hover, active, and animated effects for tactile feedback.
- **Typography:** Upgraded to Inter for a crisp, professional look.
- **Performance & SEO:** Optimized images, used Next.js font loader, and ensured fast, accessible, and SEO-friendly code.
- **Final Polish:** Ensured every section is visually and interactively consistent, with a premium, industry-standard feel.
